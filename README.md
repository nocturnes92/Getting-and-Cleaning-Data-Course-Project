Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==========================================

#How the script work

* Download and put `run_analsis.R` in a new created R project file to avoid potential error.
* Input the command `source("run_analsis.R")` to the console.
* The script will automatically download data file `getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip` from the server, but will be rename as `rojectdata.zip` in local R project file.
* Let the code run, and it will create a bunch of Data in the Global Environment.
* The final tidy data set is named as `dataset`, and the corresponding .txt file `tidy_data_set.txt` will also be generated in local R project file.
